# SmartCampus People Counter at NMBU

Welcome to the SmartCampus People Counter project at NMBU! This project aims to promote energy conservation and financial savings for the NMBU campus by optimizing room usage based on occupancy. By understanding room occupancy in real-time, the campus can make informed decisions about lighting, heating, and cooling, leading to both energy and cost savings.

Our solution uses an RGB camera to count the number of people entering and exiting a room, ensuring GDPR compliance by not capturing or storing any personal data. Built with OpenCV, this project is also designed for future integration with machine learning techniques, such as CNNs.

## Features
